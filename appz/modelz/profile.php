				'profile' => 'My passion for computers was born when I was 6 years old from a ZX Spectrum 48K. In 1993 I had access to my first PC and from there on I dedicated several hours of my life to them. Due to my passion, in high school I went to Computer Technologies and programmed in Pascal, COBOL and C++. After high school I worked as a Computer Technician and System Maintenance. I enlisted in Portuguese Army as a Transmissions Operator and after a year and a half, I decided it was time to take a university course. I went into Programming Technologies and Computer Systems at University of Aveiro and programmed in languages such as Python, VB.NET, MIPS Assembly, HTML, CSS, XML, Javascript, PHP, C #. My final project was a Web based car tuning game in ASP.NET. After University I opened a business selling Computers Hardware and went to work for AMPLITUDENET, LDA as Web Developer.<br>I’m passionate about new technologies, new challenges and constant learning.
I’m an all-in-one worker and my expertise covers contact with customers, gathering requirements, budgeting, project development and subsequent maintenance.'
